Introduction
------------

**Game Theory** is the science of strategy. It is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers, spreading across scientific disciplines like a spider's intricate web. It attempts to determine mathematically and logically the actions that players should take to secure the best outcomes for themselves in a wide array of games. The games it studies range from chess to child rearing and from tennis to takeovers, from exciting auctions to things of great importance like voting.

**Here, we study the rigorous mathematics behind this topic and explore its application in various fields.**

This report is divided into parts: Theoretical foundations of Non-Cooperative Game Theory followed by Cooperative Game Theory then Mechanism Design. Finally, I encourage you to look at different Games and their exciting results. Check out my Braess's Paradox Video [here](https://github.com/paramrathour/Game-Theory/blob/main/Braess's%20Paradox.mkv).
