            <h3>Braess's Paradox</h3>
            <p>Summer of Science <a href="http://mnp-club.github.io/">Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay</a></p>
            <p>Braess's Paradox is a Veridical Paradox which shows that creating new roads can actually slow down traffic!</p>

            <h3>Quantum Machine Learning: Opportunities and Challenges</h3>
            <p>EE350 Technical Communication</p>
            <p>Nowadays, a general purpose quantum computer seems closer to reality than ever before, yet, it is so far. Can the near-term quantum technologies create an impact on ML and guide us towards quantum supremacy? Here, we focus on quantum approaches on very a promising field of unsupervised ML after getting comfortable with all the basics.</p>

            <h3>Coded Computing for Straggler Mitigation, Security and Privacy</h3>
            <p>EE605 Error Correcting Codes</p>
            <p>Co-speaker - Anupam Nayak</p>
            <p>The massive size of modern datasets necessitates computational tasks to be performed in a distributed fashion, where the data is dispersed among many servers that operate in parallel. As we “scale out” computations across many servers, however, several fundamental challenges arise.</p>

            <h3>Computational Commutative Algebra and Geometry</h3>
            <p>EE451 Supervised Research Exposition</p>
            <p>Gröbner has interesting properties connecting computational algebraic geometry and computational commutative algebra, and also having applications in  computer algebra. Gröbner basis is a generalization of the idea of greatest common divisors of multivariable polynomials, and the row-reduced echelon form of a system of linear equations. This talk explores the theory relating commutative algebra and algebraic geometry as well as the applications of Gröbner basis and their implementations.</p>

            <h3>Dining Philosophers</h3>
            <p>CS347 Operating Systems</p>
            <p>The dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them. Here, I present my solutions (with proofs) and C implementation of this problem.</p>

            <h3>Nonlinear Dynamics</h3>
            <p>Summer of Science <a href="http://mnp-club.github.io/">Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay</a></p>
            <p>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos is a blend of applied mathematics and physical modelling, spreading across scientific disciplines like a spider's intricate web. This study can be viewed as the realisation of hundreds of years of mathematical modelling, originating with the classical mechanics of Newton and Leibniz. The report covers the mathematics behind this topic and explores its application in various fields.</p>

            <h3>Data-Driven Dynamical Systems</h3>
            <p>EE736 Introduction to Stochastic Optimization</p>
            <p>Dynamical systems provide a mathematical framework to describe the world around us, they model the rich interactions between ever evolving quantities. Currently, analytical and first-principles models are giving way to data-driven approaches in Modern dynamical systems. This paradigm shift in the study of dynamical systems is result of the convergence of big data and machine learning. This report summarises the concept of Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems.</p>

            <h3>Game Theory</h3>
            <p>Summer of Science <a href="http://mnp-club.github.igo/">Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay</a></p>
            <p>Game Theory is the science of strategy. It attempts to determine mathematically and logically the actions that players should take to secure the best outcomes for themselves in a wide array of games. Here, we study the rigorous mathematics behind this topic and explore its application in various fields.</p>
