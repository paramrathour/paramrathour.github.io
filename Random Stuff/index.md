            <h3>Game of Life</h3>
            <p>The Game of Life (sometimes known simply as Life) is an example of a cellular automaton and a zero-player game. It takes place on an infinite two-dimensional grid in which cells can be ‘on’ (alive) or ‘off’ (dead), and is defined by a set of rules that jointly determine the state of a cell given the state of its neighbours.</p>

            <h3>Langton's Ant</h3>
            <p>Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. It was runs on a square lattice of black and white cells.</p>

            <h3>Polynomial Roots</h3>
            <p>The roots (sometimes called zeroes or solutions) of a polynomial are the values of variable for which the polynomial is zero.</p>
