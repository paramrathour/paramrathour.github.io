Hello! My name is Param Rathour.

I am currently an undergraduate student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (Mumbai, India). I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Technology and Master of Technology in Electrical Engineering, with Control and Computing as my specialization. I have also completed a minor in Computer Science & Engineering.

I have changed a lot of schools in my childhood due to transfers.

I completed my education from 4th to 8th standard at Holy Cross Convent High School, Akola.

I then shifted to Latur and joined Podar International School, Latur, and completed my class 10, obtaining 10 CGPA in CBSE Board Examinations in 2017.

I finished my junior college (11th and 12th standard) at Rajarshi Shahu Mahavidyalaya, Latur, with 96.6% in CBSE Board Examinations in 2019.

I am always involved in learning new stuff and its applications.

Below are some of my interests (Consider thumbnails as recommendations).

        <h3>Recreational Mathematics Îµ></h3>
            <span class="image main"><img src="{{ site.url }}/website-assets/mathematics-for-fun.jpg" alt="Mathematics For Fun" /></span>
            <p>I love mathematics. My interest developed in 10th standard after connecting with youtube channels like Numberphile, 3Blue1Brown, Mathologer and solving logic puzzles. I learnt a lot about beauty, history and applications of mathematics from books. My interest expanded when I was able to correlate these with my JEE Preparation, and that's when this became my favourite subject.</p>
        <hr class="major" />
        <h3>Applied Mathematics</h3>
            <span class="image main"><img src="{{ site.url }}/website-assets/applied-mathematics.jpg" alt="Applied Mathematics" /></span>
            <p>Over the years at IITB, my interest in pure and applied mathematics has only grown which led me to get invested in Theoretical Computer Science and Control Theory as well. Some of my favourite books which I have delved into are given above.</p>

            <h3>Anime</h3>
            <p>It's been a while since I started watching 'anime' (2017). I remember starting Death Note and being very skeptical about this medium, but it didn't take me any time to get hooked.
            <!-- Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Gore, Historical, Horror, Miltary, Mystery, Psychological, Romance, School, Sci-fi, Slice of Life, Sports, Supernatural, Time Travel, Thriller or Tragedy; I have watched them all :D -->
            Since then, I have watched quite a lot of anime with varied genres. I majorly like character dramas infused with action, adventure, or fantasy elements. The addition of suspense, psychological, or mystery themes is a cherry on top.</p>
            <p>Recently, I have put together a few anime blogs, feel free to check out! I talk about all sorts of things, like the <a href="/blog/anime-timeline"> anime I have watched</a>, <a href="blog/hunter-hunter-little-things">my favourite anime</a>, <a href="/blog/anime-soundtracks">favourite anime music</a>, and even deep <a href="blog/philosophy-in-anime">philosophical stuff in anime</a>.</p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I love listening to music. I have quite diverse interest ranging from Old Hindi Songs to Contemporary English Songs to J-pop. My tastes vary a lot with my mood :P. Still, generally, I am most interested in cinematic music and soundtracks. Though human voice with its <a href="https://youtu.be/oCrVXdkBCeg">range</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/2rjbtsX7twc">variety</a> is amazing, for me, vocals are only as important as any other instrument.</p>

            <h3>Novels</h3>
            <p>I like reading stories with Harry Potter being my favourite. However, I haven't read a lot of books lately. I am planning to start reading again someday, sometime :).</p>

            <h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>I like playing and watching cricket and badminton.
            I started playing football in NCC sports sessions during my first year. I have enthusiasm for learning new games and will try more.</p>
            <p>My favourite team (of course after <b style="color:rgb(34, 85, 164);">India</b>) - <b class="noinversion" style="color:rgb(249,205,5);">CSK</b></p>

            <h3>Podcasts</h3>
            <p>Besides Youtube, I am an avid listener of select podcasts catering to my interests. These range from interviews with distinguished mathematicians to solving lateral thinking puzzles and also from insightful discussions on technology to trashy debates on food. Huh? Anyway here are my all-time favourite pods.</p>
