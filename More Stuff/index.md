            <h3>Braess's Paradox</h3>
            <p>Summer of Science <a href="http://mnp-club.github.io/">Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay</a></p>
            <p>Braess's Paradox is a Veridical Paradox which shows that creating new roads can actually slow down traffic!</p>

            <h3>Quantum Machine Learning: Opportunities and Challenges</h3>
            <p>EE350 Technical Communication</p>
            <p>Nowadays, a general purpose quantum computer seems closer to reality than ever before, yet, it is so far. Can the near-term quantum technologies create an impact on ML and guide us towards quantum supremacy? Here, we focus on quantum approaches on very a promising field of unsupervised ML after getting comfortable with all the basics.</p>

            <p>Co-speaker - Anupam Nayak</p>
            <p>The massive size of modern datasets necessitates computational tasks to be performed in a distributed fashion, where the data is dispersed among many servers that operate in parallel. As we “scale out” computations across many servers, however, several fundamental challenges arise.</p>

            <h3>Dining Philosophers</h3>
            <p>CS347 Operating Systems</p>
            <p>The dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them. Here, I present my solutions (with proofs) to this problem.</p>

            <h3>Nonlinear Dynamics</h3>
            <p>Summer of Science <a href="http://mnp-club.github.io/">Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay</a></p>
            <p>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos is a blend of applied mathematics and physical modelling, spreading across scientific disciplines like a spider's intricate web. Here, we study the mathematics behind this topic and explore its application in various fields.</p>

            <h3>Game Theory</h3>
            <p>Summer of Science <a href="http://mnp-club.github.igo/">Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay</a></p>
            <p>Game Theory is the science of strategy. It attempts to determine mathematically and logically the actions that players should take to secure the best outcomes for themselves in a wide array of games. Here, we study the rigorous mathematics behind this topic and explore its application in various fields.</p>
