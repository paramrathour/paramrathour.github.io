title: Student Solutions

Here are some interesting solutions by students for some of my problems from the [problem set](https://paramrathour.github.io/CS-101/Problems.pdf).

Problems marked with * are acceptable but can be made more efficent using taught methods.

A special mention to Mann Chauhan for solving almost all problems from section 1-5. I have only included his smartest solutions.
